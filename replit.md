# WhatsApp Bot for Consignado Services

## Overview

This is a streamlined Flask-based WhatsApp bot application that integrates with Z-API for WhatsApp messaging capabilities. The bot serves as an assistant for consignado (payroll loan) services, helping users by collecting their CPF numbers and providing consultation services. The system uses a simple, efficient approach focused on direct user interaction without complex database management.

## System Architecture

The application follows a simple, efficient Flask architecture:

**Backend**: Lightweight Flask application with single webhook endpoint
**External Integration**: Z-API for WhatsApp messaging services  
**Message Processing**: Direct message handling with immediate responses
**Focus**: Streamlined user experience for consignado service inquiries

## Key Components

### Core Application (`app.py`)
- Flask application factory with database initialization
- ProxyFix middleware for proper header handling in production
- Environment-based configuration for database and session management
- Integration point for all modular components

### Database Models (`models.py`)
- **Message Model**: Stores all incoming/outgoing messages with metadata
- **Conversation Model**: Manages conversation state and user progression
- Database schema designed for efficient querying with proper indexing

### Conversation Management (`conversation_manager.py`)
- Stateful conversation flow handling
- Message processing and response generation
- Integration with CPF validation services
- Error handling and session management

### CPF Validation (`cpf_validator.py`)
- Brazilian CPF number format validation
- Mathematical check digit verification algorithm
- Input sanitization and edge case handling

### WhatsApp Integration (`zapi_client.py`)
- Z-API service integration for message sending
- HTTP client with proper error handling and timeouts
- Configurable through environment variables

### Admin Interface
- **Templates**: Bootstrap-based dark theme admin dashboard
- **Static Assets**: JavaScript for real-time validation and health checks
- **Monitoring**: Conversation statistics and log viewing capabilities

## Data Flow

1. **Incoming Messages**: WhatsApp → Z-API webhook → Flask app → ConversationManager
2. **Message Processing**: ConversationManager → CPF validation → Response generation
3. **Outgoing Messages**: Flask app → ZAPIClient → Z-API → WhatsApp
4. **State Management**: All interactions stored in database for conversation continuity
5. **Admin Monitoring**: Real-time dashboard for system health and conversation tracking

## External Dependencies

### Required Services
- **Z-API**: WhatsApp Business API integration service
  - Requires ZAPI_INSTANCE_ID and ZAPI_TOKEN environment variables
  - Handles message sending and webhook receiving

### Python Packages
- **Flask**: Web framework and API development
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM and migrations
- **Requests**: HTTP client for external API calls
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI utilities and middleware

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI framework with agent dark theme
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for enhanced UI
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Client-side functionality without additional frameworks

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: Supports both SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production)
- **SESSION_SECRET**: Configurable session management
- **ZAPI credentials**: Environment-based API authentication

### Production Considerations
- ProxyFix middleware for reverse proxy compatibility
- Database connection pooling with health checks
- Comprehensive logging at DEBUG level
- Error handling with graceful degradation

### Scalability Features
- Stateless request handling (except for database state)
- Connection pooling for database efficiency
- Modular architecture for easy feature addition
